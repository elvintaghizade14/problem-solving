Terminology summary
    - Root is the topmost node of the tree
    - Edge is the link between two nodes
    - Child is a node that has a parent node
    - Parent is a node that has an edge to a child node
    - Leaf is a node that does not have a child node in the tree
    - Height is the length of the longest path to a leaf
    - Depth is the length of the path to its root

Binary trees
    “In computer science, a binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at the most two children,
    which are referred to as the left child and the right child.” — Wikipedia

    Binary tree is that it is a collection of nodes. Each node has three attributes: value, left_child, and right_child.

Tree traversals
    We have two options here: Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).

    DFS “is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree data structure. One starts at the root and explores as far as
    possible along each branch before backtracking.” — Wikipedia. Types of DFS: pre-order, in-order, and post-order.

    BFS “is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree data structure. It starts at the tree root and explores
    the neighbor nodes first, before moving to the next level neighbors.” — Wikipedia

Binary Search tree
    “A Binary Search Tree is sometimes called ordered or sorted binary trees, and it keeps its values in sorted order,
    so that lookup and other operations can use the principle of binary search” — Wikipedia
